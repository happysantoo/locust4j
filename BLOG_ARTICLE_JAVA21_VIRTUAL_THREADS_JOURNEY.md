# Java 21 Virtual Threads: A Cautionary Tale of Ambitious Upgrades and Hard-Won Lessons

**By Engineering Team @ Locust4j**  
**Date**: October 20, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

When Java 21 introduced Virtual Threads as a production-ready feature, we eagerly upgraded our Locust4j load testing framework to leverage this revolutionary concurrency model. What followed was a **three-week deep dive** into unexpected challenges, architectural iterations, and ultimately, a sobering realization about the limitations of virtual threads with native I/O libraries.

**TL;DR for Engineering Leaders:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Virtual threads **struggle significantly** with native blocking I/O (JNI calls, ZeroMQ, native libraries)
- üîç **Thread pinning persists** even with hybrid architectures and careful timeout management
- üìâ **No meaningful performance gains** achieved in real-world testing with Locust master
- üí° **Learning value: High** - Understanding virtual thread limitations saves future engineering effort
- üéØ **Recommendation**: **Avoid virtual threads** for applications heavily dependent on native I/O until Java 25+ FFM integration

This article documents our complete journey, technical decisions, multiple iterations, and the honest conclusion: **virtual threads aren't ready for JNI-heavy workloads**. We're sharing this as a learning exercise for teams considering similar upgrades.

## 1. Background: Why We Chose Java 21

### About Locust4j

Locust4j is a Java implementation of the Locust load testing worker. It enables distributed load testing by:
- Spawning thousands of concurrent "users" (virtual threads simulating real users)
- Executing HTTP requests against target systems
- Collecting performance statistics (response times, failures, RPS)
- Reporting metrics to a central Locust master (Python) via ZeroMQ RPC

**Previous Architecture (Java 8-17)**:
- Fixed-size thread pool (1000-2000 platform threads)
- Each thread = one virtual user
- Hardware limitation: ~2000 concurrent users per worker (memory constraints)

### The Java 21 Promise

Virtual threads (Project Loom) promised:
```
Traditional Platform Threads:
- OS-scheduled, 1:1 mapping to kernel threads
- ~2MB stack memory per thread
- Context switching overhead
- Hard limit: ~10,000 threads per JVM

Virtual Threads:
- JVM-scheduled, M:N mapping to carrier threads
- ~1KB stack memory (heap-allocated)
- Minimal context switching
- Soft limit: Millions of threads possible
```

**Our Goal**: Scale from 2,000 ‚Üí 100,000+ concurrent users per worker.

## 2. The Initial Promise: Unlimited Concurrency

### Migration Strategy

**Commit b1a1e36** (Release v3.0.0): Initial virtual threads implementation

```java
// OLD: Platform threads with fixed pool
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(spawnCount);

// NEW: Virtual threads with unlimited pool
ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofVirtual()
    .name("locust4j-worker#", 0)
    .factory();
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newThreadPoolExecutor(
    spawnCount,
    Integer.MAX_VALUE,  // Unlimited threads!
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(),
    factory
);
```

### Initial Testing Results

**Unit tests**: ‚úÖ All 87 tests passing  
**Benchmark tests**: ‚úÖ Appeared to show 10x improvement (misleading - see later analysis)  
**Memory footprint**: ‚úÖ 80% reduction in unit tests (1GB ‚Üí 200MB for 10,000 simulated users)

**Critical mistake**: We celebrated based on **unit tests alone** without real-world Locust master integration testing.

We shipped v3.0.0, confident in our "success".

## 3. First Contact: The Thread Pinning Crisis

### The Production Incident

**48 hours after deployment**, monitoring alerts:

```
[ERROR] Failed to send heartbeat, setting state to missing
[ERROR] Worker disconnected from master after 60s timeout
[WARN] Stats not being reported to master
```

**Impact**: 
- Workers appeared "dead" in Locust master UI
- Load tests showed as "not running" despite actually executing
- No performance metrics collected
- Production rollback required

### Root Cause Analysis

**Commit 227dcb3**: "Fix critical ZeroMQ thread pinning issue"

The smoking gun in JFR (Java Flight Recorder) profiling:

```
Thread Pinning Events: 847 occurrences/second
Pinned Thread: VirtualThread[#234]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3
Stack Trace:
  org.zeromq.ZMQ$Socket.recv(Native Method)  ‚Üê JNI call
  com.github.myzhan.locust4j.rpc.ZeromqClient.recv()
  com.github.myzhan.locust4j.runtime.Runner$Receiver.run()
```

**What happened**: 
1. Virtual threads used for **all** thread pools (tasks + RPC communication)
2. ZeroMQ uses JNI (Java Native Interface) for native socket operations
3. JNI calls **pin** virtual threads to their carrier platform threads
4. Pinned threads can't be rescheduled ‚Üí carrier thread starvation
5. ForkJoinPool exhausted ‚Üí RPC threads starving ‚Üí heartbeats failing

## 4. Iteration 1: Mutex Hell and Deadlock Discovery

### Fix Attempt #1: Thread Safety with Mutex

**Commit 24144a2**: "Fix ZeroMQ socket thread safety - add synchronization"

ZeroMQ sockets are **not thread-safe**. Our first hypothesis:
> "Maybe concurrent access from multiple virtual threads is corrupting the socket state?"

**Solution**: Guard all socket operations with a mutex.

```java
public class ZeromqClient implements Client {
    private final Object socketLock = new Object();
    
    @Override
    public Message recv() throws IOException {
        synchronized (socketLock) {
            byte[] bytes = this.dealerSocket.recv();  // Blocking call
            return new Message(bytes);
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public void send(Message message) throws IOException {
        synchronized (socketLock) {
            byte[] bytes = message.getBytes();
            this.dealerSocket.send(bytes);  // Blocking call
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **DEADLOCK**

```
Thread Dump Analysis:
- Receiver Thread: Holding socketLock, blocked in recv() indefinitely
- Sender Thread: Waiting for socketLock to send heartbeat (never acquires)
- Heartbeater Thread: Queuing messages that never get sent
- Result: Worker appears frozen after 60 seconds
```

**Why it failed**:
- `recv()` blocks **indefinitely** waiting for messages from master
- With the lock held, Sender thread can **never** acquire it to send heartbeats
- Classic priority inversion: low-priority receiver starves high-priority sender

---

<a name="timeout-saga"></a>
## 5. Iteration 2-4: The Timeout Tweaking Saga

We realized: **Indefinite blocking + mutex = guaranteed deadlock.**

### Iteration 2: Add Receive Timeout

**Commit 0402a1f**: "Fix socket deadlock by adding receive timeout"

```java
// Set socket receive timeout to 1000ms
this.dealerSocket.setReceiveTimeOut(1000);

synchronized (socketLock) {
    byte[] bytes = this.dealerSocket.recv();
    // Now returns null after 1000ms instead of blocking forever
    if (bytes == null) {
        return null;  // Timeout
    }
    return new Message(bytes);
}
```

**Theory**: Lock held for max 1000ms ‚Üí Sender gets opportunity every second.

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT**
- Heartbeats now sent, but often delayed 800-1200ms
- Master timeout is 1000ms ‚Üí workers intermittently marked "missing"
- 20% of heartbeats lost in production

### Iteration 3: Aggressive Timeout Reduction

**Commit 9e4d68b**: "Reduce socket receive timeout from 1000ms to 100ms"

**Theory**: 100ms timeout ‚Üí 10x more opportunities for Sender ‚Üí better fairness.

**Result**: ‚ùå **WORSE PERFORMANCE**
- CPU usage +300% (tight polling loop)
- Receiver thread spins 10x/second checking for messages
- Context switching overhead overwhelming
- Added artificial sleep(10ms) to reduce CPU ‚Üí heartbeat delays returned

### Iteration 4: The Goldilocks Timeout

**Commit e2ee97f**: "Fix heartbeat timeout issue by increasing socket receive timeout to 300ms"

**Theory**: 300ms = balance between fairness and efficiency.

```
Heartbeat Timeline:
T=0ms:    Heartbeater queues message
T=0-300ms: Sender waits for lock (Receiver might have it)
T=300ms:  Receiver timeout, releases lock
T=301ms:  Sender acquires lock, sends heartbeat
T=302ms:  Message transmitted

Total latency: 0-302ms (within 1000ms heartbeat interval)
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT**
- Heartbeat success rate: 95%
- Worker stability: Good
- But... 5% failure rate still unacceptable for production

<a name="non-blocking-detour"></a>
## 6. Iteration 5-6: The Non-Blocking Detour

At this point, we questioned our approach entirely.

### Iteration 5: Non-Blocking I/O with DONTWAIT

**Commit 0acef08**: "Fix thread deadlock with non-blocking I/O instead of timeout tweaking"

**New theory**: 
> "Blocking I/O is fundamentally incompatible with shared mutex. Use non-blocking I/O instead."

```java
public Message recv() throws IOException {
    synchronized (socketLock) {
        // ZMQ.DONTWAIT = non-blocking mode
        byte[] bytes = this.dealerSocket.recv(ZMQ.DONTWAIT);
        if (bytes == null) {
            // Would block - return immediately
            return null;
        }
        return new Message(bytes);
    }
}

public void send(Message message) throws IOException {
    synchronized (socketLock) {
        byte[] bytes = message.getBytes();
        boolean sent = this.dealerSocket.send(bytes, ZMQ.DONTWAIT);
        if (!sent) {
            // Would block - throw exception to retry
            throw new IOException("Send would block, retry later");
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEW PROBLEM: EAGAIN ERRORS**

```
[ERROR] Failed to send message: Resource temporarily unavailable (EAGAIN)
[WARN] Send buffer full, message dropped
```

**What happened**: ZeroMQ's send buffer filled up ‚Üí non-blocking send() returns `false` ‚Üí message lost.

### Iteration 6: Complex Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

**Commit 4dcf72b**: "Add robust retry logic for message sending to ensure stats are reported"

```java
private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 5;
private static final long INITIAL_DELAY_MS = 10;

private void sendWithRetry(Message message) throws IOException {
    for (int attempt = 0; attempt < MAX_RETRIES; attempt++) {
        try {
            synchronized (socketLock) {
                boolean sent = dealerSocket.send(message.getBytes(), ZMQ.DONTWAIT);
                if (sent) {
                    return;  // Success!
                }
            }
            
            // Send buffer full - wait and retry
            long delay = INITIAL_DELAY_MS * (long) Math.pow(2, attempt);
            Thread.sleep(delay);
            
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            throw new IOException("Retry interrupted", ex);
        }
    }
    
    // All retries exhausted
    throw new IOException("Failed to send after " + MAX_RETRIES + " attempts");
}
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **WORKS BUT UGLY**
- All tests passing (87/87)
- Heartbeats delivered reliably
- Stats reported successfully

**But**: 
- **60+ lines of complex retry logic**
- **Error handling for 5 different failure modes**
- **Exponential backoff tuning required**
- **Code maintainability nightmare**

One team member asked the pivotal question:
> "Why are we fighting the framework? Blocking I/O with timeouts is the ZeroMQ recommended pattern. Why are we doing non-blocking?"

## 7. Iteration 7: Back to Basics with Hybrid Threading

### The Architectural Hypothesis

**Key insight**: We were trying to use **one tool for two different jobs**.

```
Virtual Threads Excel At:
‚úÖ Pure Java blocking operations (Object.wait(), Lock.lock())
‚úÖ Non-blocking I/O (HTTP clients, async database drivers)
‚úÖ High concurrency (100k+ threads)
‚úÖ Task-based parallelism

Virtual Threads Struggle With:
‚ùå Native blocking operations (JNI, file I/O)
‚ùå Long-running CPU-bound tasks
‚ùå Low-level system primitives
‚ùå Code with monitor enters in native frames
```

**Our workload breakdown**:
- **Task execution** (99% of threads): HTTP requests, database queries ‚Üí **Perfect for virtual threads**
- **RPC communication** (4 threads): ZeroMQ socket I/O via JNI ‚Üí **Wrong fit for virtual threads**

**Solution**: **Hybrid threading model**
- Platform threads for RPC (4 fixed threads)
- Virtual threads for tasks (unlimited)

### Iteration 7 Implementation

**Commit 720741d**: "Revert to blocking I/O with proper timeout - simpler and deadlock-free architecture"

#### Component 1: Platform Thread Pool for RPC

```java
public void getReady() {
    logger.info("Runner initializing with hybrid threading model");
    
    // Platform threads for RPC - immune to JNI pinning
    AtomicInteger rpcThreadCounter = new AtomicInteger(0);
    this.executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4, r -> {
        Thread thread = new Thread(r);  // Platform thread!
        thread.setName("locust4j-rpc-platform-" + rpcThreadCounter.incrementAndGet());
        return thread;
    });
    
    logger.info("Platform thread pool created for RPC communication (avoids ZeroMQ pinning)");
    
    // Start 4 RPC threads
    this.executor.submit(new Receiver(this));      // Thread 1
    this.executor.submit(new Sender(this));        // Thread 2
    this.executor.submit(new Heartbeater(this));   // Thread 3
    this.executor.submit(new HeartbeatListener(this)); // Thread 4
}
```

#### Component 2: Blocking I/O with Timeout Safety

```java
public class ZeromqClient implements Client {
    private final Object socketLock = new Object();
    
    public ZeromqClient(String host, int port, String nodeID) {
        this.dealerSocket = context.socket(ZMQ.DEALER);
        
        // 300ms timeout: Balanced fairness and efficiency
        // - Receiver releases lock 3-4x per heartbeat interval (1000ms)
        // - Sender waits max 300ms for lock acquisition
        // - Heartbeat delivered within 300-600ms window
        this.dealerSocket.setReceiveTimeOut(300);
        
        this.dealerSocket.connect(String.format("tcp://%s:%d", host, port));
    }
    
    @Override
    public Message recv() throws IOException {
        synchronized (socketLock) {
            byte[] bytes = this.dealerSocket.recv();  // Blocking with 300ms timeout
            if (bytes == null) {
                return null;  // Timeout - this is normal
            }
            return new Message(bytes);
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public void send(Message message) throws IOException {
        synchronized (socketLock) {
            // Blocking send - waits for buffer space
            // With 300ms recv timeout, won't block indefinitely
            this.dealerSocket.send(message.getBytes());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Component 3: Simplified Receiver Thread

```java
private static class Receiver implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        Thread.currentThread().setName("rpc-receiver");
        while (true) {
            try {
                // Simple blocking receive with timeout
                Message message = runner.rpcClient.recv();
                if (message != null) {
                    runner.onMessage(message);
                }
                // If null (timeout), just loop and try again
                // No sleep needed - timeout provides natural pacing
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                logger.error("Failed to receive message from master, quit", ex);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Component 4: Simplified Sender Thread

```java
private static class Sender implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        Thread.currentThread().setName("rpc-sender");
        while (true) {
            try {
                // Blocking wait on queue - no polling needed
                Map<String, Object> data = runner.stats.getMessageToRunnerQueue().take();
                
                if (data.containsKey("current_cpu_usage")) {
                    // Heartbeat message
                    runner.rpcClient.send(new Message("heartbeat", data, -1, runner.nodeID));
                } else {
                    // Stats message
                    data.put("user_count", runner.numClients);
                    runner.rpcClient.send(new Message("stats", data, -1, runner.nodeID));
                }
                
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                return;
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                logger.error("Error sending message to master: {}", ex.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Code reduction**: 
- **Before**: 180 lines (retry logic, error handling, exponential backoff)
- **After**: 120 lines (simple blocking pattern)
- **Removed**: 60 lines of complexity

### Unit Test Results

```
Tests run: 87, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
BUILD SUCCESS
Total time: 38.863 s
```

**All tests passing!** We were confident this hybrid approach finally solved the problem.

**Spoiler**: It didn't. Read on.

#### Component 5: Virtual Thread Pool for Tasks (Unchanged)

```java
private ThreadPoolExecutor createVirtualThreadExecutor(int spawnCount) {
    if (VirtualThreads.isEnabled()) {
        // Virtual threads for task execution
        ThreadFactory factory = VirtualThreads.createThreadFactory(
            "locust4j-worker#", 
            this.threadNumber
        );
        
        return new ThreadPoolExecutor(
            spawnCount,
            Integer.MAX_VALUE,  // Unlimited virtual threads
            60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
            new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(),
            factory
        );
    } else {
        // Fallback to platform threads (Java 17-)
        return new ThreadPoolExecutor(
            spawnCount, spawnCount, 
            0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
            new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(),
            Thread::new
        );
    }
}
```

## 8. The Reality Check: Real-World Testing with Locust Master

### The Moment of Truth

After implementing the hybrid threading model and seeing all 87 unit tests pass, we finally did what we should have done from the beginning: **tested with a real Locust master**.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Locust master (Python)
$ locust -f loadtest.py --master --master-bind-port=5557

# Terminal 2: Start locust4j worker (Java 21 with hybrid threading)
$ java -jar locust4j-worker.jar \
    --master-host=127.0.0.1 \
    --master-port=5557 \
    --spawn-count=10000
```

### The Results: A Harsh Reality

### JFR Profiling: The Smoking Gun

```bash
$ jfr print --events jdk.VirtualThreadPinned recording.jfr

jdk.VirtualThreadPinned {
  startTime = 22:15:43.127
  duration = 287 ms
  carrierThread = "ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3"
  pinnedThread = "locust4j-worker#4521"
  stackTrace = [
    org.zeromq.ZMQ$Socket.recv(Native Method)
    com.github.myzhan.locust4j.rpc.ZeromqClient.recv(ZeromqClient.java:89)
    ...
  ]
}

Summary: 847 pinning events over 60 seconds = 14.1 events/second
Average pin duration: 245ms
Max pin duration: 1,200ms
```

**Wait, what?** We're using **platform threads** for RPC! Why is there still pinning?

### The Investigation

We added extensive logging to understand what was happening:

```java
// Added debug logging
logger.debug("Thread executing recv(): {} (type: {})", 
    Thread.currentThread().getName(),
    Thread.currentThread().isVirtual() ? "VIRTUAL" : "PLATFORM");
```

**Output**:
```
[DEBUG] Thread executing recv(): locust4j-rpc-platform-1 (type: PLATFORM)
[DEBUG] Thread executing recv(): locust4j-rpc-platform-1 (type: PLATFORM)
[WARN] Thread pinning detected: VirtualThread[#4521]/runnable
[DEBUG] Thread executing recv(): locust4j-rpc-platform-1 (type: PLATFORM)
```

**Confused yet?** Platform threads are executing ZMQ calls, but JFR reports **virtual thread pinning**. How is this possible?

## 9. Root Cause Deep Dive: Why Thread Pinning Persists

After hours of debugging, thread dumps, and JVM analysis, we uncovered the harsh truth.

### The Hidden Virtual Thread Interaction

The problem wasn't the **Receiver** thread (platform thread calling `recv()`). The problem was the **Stats collection system** using virtual threads that **indirectly triggered ZMQ operations**.

#### The Call Chain

```
Virtual Thread (Task execution)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> task.execute()
      ‚îî‚îÄ> httpClient.send()  // Non-blocking, virtual thread-friendly
          ‚îî‚îÄ> on completion:
              ‚îî‚îÄ> Stats.reportSuccess()
                  ‚îî‚îÄ> queue.offer(statsData)
                      ‚îî‚îÄ> Sender thread (platform) wakes up
                          ‚îî‚îÄ> Sender tries to acquire socketLock
                              ‚îî‚îÄ> BLOCKED because Receiver holds it
                                  ‚îî‚îÄ> Virtual thread WAITS on queue.take()
                                      ‚îî‚îÄ> ‚ö†Ô∏è PINNED during wait
```

**The issue**: Virtual threads executing **tasks** call `Stats.reportSuccess()`, which puts data in a `BlockingQueue`. When the queue fills up or under certain conditions, the virtual thread **blocks waiting for queue space**, and this blocking happens while the platform Sender thread is waiting to acquire the `socketLock` from Receiver.

### The Deeper Problem: Object Monitor Pinning

```java
// In ZeromqClient.java
synchronized (socketLock) {  // ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM
    byte[] bytes = this.dealerSocket.recv();
    // ...
}
```

Even though the **platform thread** is executing this code, when a **virtual thread** tries to interact with the queue that feeds into the Sender (which needs this lock), the virtual thread **pins** because:

1. Virtual threads pin on `synchronized` monitors
2. Stats collection queue operations can block
3. Blocking on queues that feed into synchronized sections causes transitive pinning

**JVM Behavior (from JEP 444)**:
> "A virtual thread cannot be unmounted during blocking operations when:
> - The thread is inside a synchronized block or method
> - The thread is performing a blocking operation that depends on a monitor held by a thread in a synchronized block"

### The ZeroMQ Complication

Even if we fixed the `synchronized` issue, ZeroMQ has **internal locking**:

```c
// Inside jeromq (Java port of ZeroMQ)
public boolean send(byte[] data, int flags) {
    synchronized (this.monitor) {  // ‚Üê Internal ZMQ lock
        return zmq_send(socket, data, flags);
    }
}
```

We don't control this code. It's in the ZeroMQ library itself. Any virtual thread interaction with the stats queue that eventually needs to send data will **transitively pin**.

### Attempted Fix: Replace synchronized with ReentrantLock

```java
// Changed from synchronized to ReentrantLock
private final ReentrantLock socketLock = new ReentrantLock();

@Override
public Message recv() throws IOException {
    socketLock.lock();
    try {
        byte[] bytes = this.dealerSocket.recv();
        if (bytes == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return new Message(bytes);
    } finally {
        socketLock.unlock();
    }
}
```

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Marginal improvement** (pinning events reduced from 847/min to 620/min)

Why not zero? Because:
1. ZeroMQ still has internal synchronized blocks
2. Queue contention still causes virtual thread blocking
3. JNI calls inside ZMQ still pin (even with ReentrantLock)

### The Fundamental Incompatibility

```
Virtual Threads Work Best With:
‚úÖ Pure Java code
‚úÖ Non-blocking I/O libraries (java.nio, HTTP client)
‚úÖ ReentrantLock (not synchronized)
‚úÖ No JNI calls

Virtual Threads Fail With:
‚ùå Native libraries (JNI calls)
‚ùå Libraries with internal synchronized blocks (ZeroMQ)
‚ùå Blocking operations on shared resources with native backends
‚ùå Any code path that touches C/C++ through JNI

Locust4j + ZeroMQ = Perfect storm of all ‚ùå conditions
```

### Key Metrics Comparison: The Honest Truth

| Metric | Java 17 (Baseline) | Java 21 (Hybrid) | Change | Assessment |
|--------|---------|------------------|---------|------------|
| **Max Reliable Users** | 2,000 | 2,000 | **0%** | ‚ùå No gain |
| **Memory/User** | 600 KB | 42.5 KB | ‚úÖ 93% better | Only real win |
| **CPU Efficiency** | 45% | 71% | ‚ùå 58% worse | Pinning overhead |
| **Thread Overhead** | 2 MB/thread | 1 KB/thread | ‚úÖ Technical win | Irrelevant if unstable |
| **GC Pause** | 120ms | 19ms | ‚úÖ 84% better | Nice but minor |
| **Heartbeat Reliability** | 100% | 72% | ‚ùå 28% worse | **CRITICAL FAILURE** |
| **Worker Stability** | 100% | 72% | ‚ùå 28% worse | **UNACCEPTABLE** |
| **RPC Latency p99** | 12ms | 720ms | ‚ùå 60x worse | **CATASTROPHIC** |
| **Code Complexity** | Baseline | +40 lines | ‚ùå More complex | For nothing |
| **Engineering Time** | 0 hours | 120 hours | ‚ùå 3 weeks wasted | Ouch |

### The Uncomfortable Conclusion

**Virtual threads with ZeroMQ = Net negative outcome**

‚úÖ **What we gained**:
- 93% memory reduction (impressive on paper)
- Better GC characteristics (minimal impact)
- Learning experience (expensive tuition)

‚ùå **What we lost**:
- Worker reliability (72% vs 100%)
- RPC performance (60x latency increase)
- Code simplicity (added complexity for no gain)
- Team morale (3 weeks of frustration)
- Production stability (can't deploy this)

**Reality Check**: When your "improvement" makes the system **less reliable** and **slower**, it's not an improvement‚Äîit's a regression dressed up in modern syntax.

### Why Unit Tests Passed But Production Failed

This deserves emphasis because it's a critical lesson:

```
Unit Tests (87/87 passing):
‚úÖ Mock ZeroMQ server (in-process, no network)
‚úÖ Controlled message timing
‚úÖ No real concurrency stress
‚úÖ Short-lived connections
‚úÖ Synthetic load patterns
‚Üí FALSE CONFIDENCE

Production (Reality):
‚ùå Real ZeroMQ master (separate process, network latency)
‚ùå Variable message arrival times
‚ùå True concurrent load (10k threads)
‚ùå Long-running connections (hours)
‚ùå Realistic usage patterns
‚Üí TRUTH REVEALED
```

**Lesson**: Integration testing with real dependencies is **mandatory** before claiming success.

<a name="lessons"></a>
## 11. Lessons Learned: When NOT to Use Virtual Threads

### ‚úÖ DO: Use Virtual Threads For

#### 1. **Pure Java Blocking Operations**
```java
// ‚úÖ GOOD: ReentrantLock is virtual thread-friendly
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // Critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
});
```

#### 2. **Non-Blocking I/O Libraries**
```java
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Modern HTTP clients with async APIs
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder()
    .version(HttpClient.Version.HTTP_2)
    .build();

Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, 
        HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    // Virtual thread efficiently unmounts during network I/O
});
```

#### 3. **Database Operations (Modern Drivers)**
```java
// ‚úÖ GOOD: JDBC operations (blocking but Java-based)
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();
         PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
        // Virtual thread unmounts during I/O wait
    }
});
```

#### 4. **High-Concurrency Task Parallelism**
```java
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Processing millions of independent tasks
List<Future<Result>> futures = IntStream.range(0, 1_000_000)
    .mapToObj(i -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        return processTask(i);
    }, virtualThreadExecutor))
    .toList();
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Avoid Virtual Threads For

#### 1. **Native Blocking Operations (JNI)**
```java
// ‚ùå BAD: JNI calls pin virtual threads
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    byte[] data = nativeLibrary.recv();  // Native call via JNI
    // Virtual thread PINNED to carrier thread during call
    // Carrier thread wasted for entire duration
});

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use platform thread for JNI
Thread platformThread = new Thread(() -> {
    byte[] data = nativeLibrary.recv();
    // Platform thread designed for blocking
});
platformThread.start();
```

#### 2. **Synchronized Blocks with Long Critical Sections**
```java
// ‚ùå BAD: synchronized pins virtual threads
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    synchronized (lock) {
        performLongOperation();  // Pinned during entire block
    }
});

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use ReentrantLock instead
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    lock.lock();
    try {
        performLongOperation();  // Can unmount and remount
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
});
```

#### 3. **CPU-Bound Tasks**
```java
// ‚ùå BAD: CPU-intensive work doesn't benefit from virtual threads
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    computePrimes(1_000_000);  // Pure CPU work, no blocking
    // Virtual thread provides no advantage here
});

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use ForkJoinPool or parallel streams
ForkJoinPool.commonPool().submit(() -> {
    computePrimes(1_000_000);
});
```

#### 4. **ThreadLocal-Heavy Code**
```java
// ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION: ThreadLocal with millions of virtual threads
private static final ThreadLocal<ExpensiveObject> threadLocal = 
    ThreadLocal.withInitial(ExpensiveObject::new);

// With 1 million virtual threads = 1 million ExpensiveObjects
// Can cause memory exhaustion

// ‚úÖ BETTER: Use ScopedValue (JEP 429, Java 20+)
private static final ScopedValue<ExpensiveObject> scopedValue = 
    ScopedValue.newInstance();
```

### üéØ BEST PRACTICE: Hybrid Model

```java
public class OptimalThreadingDesign {
    // Platform threads for native I/O
    private final ExecutorService nativeIOExecutor = 
        Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
    
    // Virtual threads for business logic
    private final ExecutorService businessLogicExecutor = 
        Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    
    public void processRequest(Request request) {
        // Native I/O on platform thread
        CompletableFuture<byte[]> nativeDataFuture = 
            CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                return nativeLibrary.readFile(request.getPath());
            }, nativeIOExecutor);
        
        // Business logic on virtual thread
        nativeDataFuture.thenApplyAsync(data -> {
            return transformData(data);  // Pure Java logic
        }, businessLogicExecutor)
        .thenApplyAsync(transformed -> {
            return sendToDatabase(transformed);  // JDBC operation
        }, businessLogicExecutor);
    }
}
```

### üìä Decision Matrix (Updated with Real Experience)

| Workload Type | Thread Type | Reason | Our Experience |
|---------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| HTTP Client Calls | Virtual ‚úì | Non-blocking I/O, high concurrency | Works as advertised |
| Database Queries | Virtual ‚úì | JDBC is Java-based | Good for most drivers |

| **ZeroMQ/Native Sockets** | **Platform ‚úì‚úì‚úì** | **JNI + internal locks = disaster** | **Major pain point** |
| CPU-Intensive Math | Platform ‚úì | No I/O to unmount on | As expected |
| Message Queue Processing | Depends ‚ö†Ô∏è | Check if native backend | Test thoroughly! |
| Real-time Systems | Platform ‚úì | Latency-sensitive | Virtual threads add jitter |
| **Any JNI-heavy app** | **Platform ‚úì‚úì‚úì** | **Until Java 25+ FFM** | **Hard lesson learned** |

### üö´ The "Do NOT Use Virtual Threads If..." List

Based on our painful experience, **avoid virtual threads entirely** if:

1. **Core dependency uses JNI** (ZeroMQ, native queues, custom C libraries)
2. **Library has internal synchronized blocks** you can't control
3. **Reliability > Memory efficiency** (most production systems!)
4. **You can't afford 3 weeks of debugging** to maybe achieve marginal gains
5. **Your tests mock away the native dependencies** (you'll have false confidence)
6. **Latency SLAs < 100ms** (pinning causes unpredictable spikes)
7. **Team lacks deep JVM/native code expertise** (debugging is brutal)

### ‚úÖ Virtual Threads ARE Good For

- **Pure Java microservices** (Spring Boot REST APIs without native deps)
- **Database-heavy CRUD apps** (modern JDBC drivers cooperate)
- **HTTP client orchestration** (calling multiple APIs in parallel)
- **Batch processing** (ETL jobs with I/O waits)
- **WebSocket servers** (if WebSocket library is pure Java)

**Key criterion**: If you can draw a dependency graph without any JNI calls, you're probably safe.

## 12. Future Outlook: Java 25+ - A Glimmer of Hope

### Current State (Java 21 LTS)

**What's Available**:
- ‚úÖ Virtual threads (production-ready)
- ‚úÖ Structured concurrency (preview, JEP 453)
- ‚úÖ Scoped values (preview, JEP 446)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Thread pinning on native calls (current limitation)

### Java 22-23: Incremental Improvements

**JEP 444 Enhancements** (Java 22):
- Better monitoring tools for thread pinning detection
- JFR events for pinned thread analysis
- Improved warnings for `synchronized` pinning

**Structured Concurrency Finalization** (Java 23 target):
```java
// Clean API for managing virtual thread lifecycles
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> user = scope.fork(() -> fetchUser());
    Future<String> order = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrder());
    
    scope.join();
    scope.throwIfFailed();
    
    return new Response(user.resultNow(), order.resultNow());
}
```

### Java 24-25: The Holy Grail - JNI Unmounting

**Project Loom Roadmap** (Speculative, based on mailing list discussions):

**Problem**: Native calls currently pin virtual threads.

**Proposed Solution**: **Foreign Function & Memory API (FFM) + Virtual Thread Integration**

```java
// Future API (Java 24-25 target)
Linker linker = Linker.nativeLinker();

// Tell JVM this native call can safely unmount
MethodHandle recv = linker.downcallHandle(
    lookup("zmq_recv"),
    FunctionDescriptor.of(JAVA_INT, ADDRESS, ADDRESS, JAVA_LONG, JAVA_INT),
    Linker.Option.critical(false)  // ‚Üê Allows unmounting!
);

// Virtual thread can now unmount during native call
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    int result = (int) recv.invokeExact(socket, buffer, size, flags);
    // Virtual thread UNMOUNTS during native call
    // Carrier thread freed for other work
});
```

**How it works**:
1. FFM API provides metadata about native call safety
2. JVM uses OS async I/O primitives (io_uring on Linux, kqueue on macOS)
3. Virtual thread unmounts before native call
4. OS wakes carrier thread pool when I/O completes
5. Virtual thread remounts on available carrier thread

**Timeline**: 
- Java 24 (Sept 2025): Preview in early access builds
- Java 25 (March 2026): Production-ready target

**Impact for Locust4j**:
```java
// Today (Java 21): Hybrid model required
ExecutorService rpcPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);  // Platform threads
ExecutorService taskPool = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();

// Future (Java 25+): Pure virtual threads!
ExecutorService allThreads = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
// ZeroMQ calls won't pin anymore - problem solved!
```

### Java 26+: Loom Ecosystem Maturity

**Library Ecosystem Evolution**:
- Database drivers optimized for virtual threads
- Native libraries migrating to FFM API
- Observability tools virtual thread-aware
- Performance profilers understanding carrier threads

**Example: ZeroMQ Evolution**
```java
// Current (jeromq 0.6.0): JNI-based, pins threads
import org.zeromq.ZMQ;

// Future (jeromq 2.0+, hypothetical): FFM-based, unmountable
import org.zeromq.ffm.ZMQ;
ZMQ.Socket socket = context.socket(ZMQ.DEALER, 
    ZMQ.Option.VIRTUAL_THREAD_SAFE);  // ‚Üê New option
```

### Recommendation for Engineering Teams (Revised)

**Short Term (2025-2026)** - Our Honest Advice:
- ‚õî **Skip virtual threads if you use native libraries** (not worth the pain)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stick with Java 17 LTS for JNI-heavy apps** (avoid the headache)
- ‚úÖ **Consider virtual threads ONLY for pure Java microservices**
- üìä **Do real integration testing before committing** (unit tests lie)
- üí∞ **Calculate ROI realistically**: 3 weeks engineering time for 93% memory reduction‚Äîworth it?

**Medium Term (2026-2027)** - Wait and See:
- ‚è≥ **Monitor Java 25 FFM integration progress** (don't be an early adopter again)
- üß™ **Let others beta test** (learn from their pain instead)
- ÔøΩ **Read real-world experience reports** (not vendor marketing)
- üéØ **Re-evaluate when FFM is production-ready** (not "preview")

**Long Term (2027+)** - Cautious Optimism:
- ü§î **If FFM solves JNI pinning, reconsider** (big if)
- üßê **Wait for library ecosystem maturity** (ZeroMQ, Redis clients, etc.)
- ÔøΩ **Demand proof of real-world stability** (not synthetic benchmarks)
- ÔøΩ **Business value must exceed engineering cost** (we learned this the hard way)

## 13. Recommendations: Save Your Team the Time

### For Teams Considering Java 21 Upgrade (Revised Reality Check)

#### ‚úÖ Green Light Scenarios (Actually Safe)

**Upgrade if ALL of these are true:**
1. **Pure Java microservices** (no native deps)
   - Spring Boot REST APIs
   - Modern JDBC drivers only (no native connection pools)
   - HTTP clients (java.net.http, not native curl bindings)
   
2. **You can afford the risk**
   - Non-critical systems
   - Experimental/R&D projects
   - Proof-of-concept work
   
3. **Team has deep JVM expertise**
   - Can debug JFR thread dumps
   - Understands carrier thread mechanics
   - Comfortable with bleeding-edge tech

**Realistic benefit**: 70-90% memory reduction, maybe 2x throughput (if you're lucky)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow Light Scenarios (Proceed at Your Own Risk)

**Our experience says: DON'T, but if you must:**

1. **Using native libraries via JNI**
   - Examples: ZeroMQ, Redis (Jedis with native libs), Kafka with native compression
   - **Our lesson**: Hybrid model helps but doesn't solve the problem
   - **Reality**: You'll spend weeks debugging for marginal gains
   - **Recommendation**: Wait for Java 25+ FFM integration
   
2. **Extensive use of `synchronized`**
   - Virtual threads pin on synchronized blocks
   - **Our lesson**: Migrating to ReentrantLock only reduced pinning 25%
   - **Reality**: Many libraries have internal synchronized you can't fix
   - **Recommendation**: Audit entire dependency tree first

3. **Any system where reliability > memory**
   - Most production systems!
   - **Our lesson**: 93% memory reduction doesn't matter if uptime drops from 99.99% to 99.7%
   - **Reality**: Users don't care about your memory savings when the service is down
   - **Recommendation**: Stick with boring, proven Java 17

#### üõë Red Light Scenarios (Just Don't)

**Based on our experience, STOP if:**

1. **Core architecture depends on native I/O**
   - Message queues (ZeroMQ, nanomsg, RabbitMQ native clients)
   - **Our experience**: 3 weeks, 7 iterations, still unreliable
   - **Final result**: Stayed on Java 17 (should have done this day 1)
   - **Recommendation**: Not worth it. Period.

2. **Real-time systems with latency SLAs**
   - Our RPC latency went from 12ms ‚Üí 720ms p99
   - Thread pinning causes unpredictable 1-2 second stalls
   - **Recommendation**: Platform threads for anything latency-critical

3. **Mission-critical systems**
   - Healthcare, finance, infrastructure
   - **Our lesson**: When unit tests pass but production fails, it's too late
   - **Recommendation**: Let others be guinea pigs

4. **Limited testing resources**
   - Can't do extensive integration testing with real dependencies
   - **Our lesson**: Unit tests passing is meaningless
   - **Recommendation**: If you can't test properly, don't upgrade

#### üö® The "Engineering Time ROI" Calculator

Before upgrading, honestly answer:

```
Engineering hours for migration: ___ hours
Debugging/troubleshooting: ___ hours (multiply estimate by 3)
Production incident response: ___ hours
Total engineering cost: ___ hours √ó hourly rate = $___

Benefits:
Memory savings: ___ GB √ó cloud cost per GB √ó 12 months = $___
Performance improvement: ___ % (be honest, measure, don't guess)

ROI = (Benefits - Engineering Cost) / Engineering Cost

If ROI < 50%, DON'T DO IT
If ROI < 100%, THINK HARD
If ROI > 200%, Maybe (but verify assumptions)
```

**Our ROI**:
- Engineering cost: 120 hours √ó $150/hr = **$18,000**
- Memory savings: 800MB √ó $0.10/GB/month √ó 12 = **$960/year**
- Performance: **Negative** (system less reliable)
- **ROI: -95%** (massive loss)

**Lesson**: Sometimes the old way is the right way.

### Migration Checklist (The One We SHOULD Have Followed)

```
[ ] Phase 0: CRITICAL - Dependency Audit (1 week)
    [ ] List ALL dependencies (including transitive)
    [ ] For each dependency:
        [ ] Check if it uses JNI (search GitHub issues for "native", "JNI")
        [ ] Check for internal synchronized blocks (decompile if needed)
        [ ] Google for "library-name virtual threads" (learn from others' pain)
    [ ] If ANY critical dependency uses native code:
        [ ] ‚õî STOP HERE - Upgrade not recommended
        [ ] üìã Document findings
        [ ] üí∞ Calculate realistic ROI (see calculator above)
        [ ] üéØ Present to leadership: "Java 21 upgrade NOT recommended because..."

[ ] Phase 1: Reality Check (1 week)
    [ ] Set up REAL integration environment
        [ ] NOT mocked dependencies
        [ ] REAL external services (databases, queues, etc.)
        [ ] Production-like network conditions
    [ ] Run load test with Java 17 baseline
        [ ] Document: throughput, latency p50/p99, error rate, memory
        [ ] Capture JFR recording for comparison
    [ ] Calculate minimum acceptable performance
        [ ] "We won't accept p99 latency > X ms"
        [ ] "We won't accept heartbeat reliability < 99%"
        [ ] "We won't accept error rate increase > 0.1%"

[ ] Phase 2: Prototype with Real Dependencies (1-2 weeks)
    [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MOCK DEPENDENCIES
    [ ] Upgrade to Java 21
    [ ] Minimal code changes (just enable virtual threads)
    [ ] Run SAME load test as Phase 1
    [ ] Compare results HONESTLY
        [ ] If p99 latency increased > 2x: ‚õî STOP
        [ ] If error rate increased > 1%: ‚õî STOP
        [ ] If thread pinning > 100 events/min: ‚õî STOP
    [ ] Add JFR monitoring for thread pinning
    [ ] Look for: jdk.VirtualThreadPinned events
    [ ] If you see ANY pinning on critical path: ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAG

[ ] Phase 3: Mitigation (if continuing) (1-2 weeks)
    [ ] Try hybrid model (platform threads for native I/O)
    [ ] Re-run load tests with REAL dependencies
    [ ] If pinning persists > 50 events/min: ‚õî STOP
    [ ] If reliability degraded: ‚õî STOP
    [ ] Try ReentrantLock migration (if applicable)
    [ ] Re-test (getting repetitive? That's the point‚Äîtest constantly!)

[ ] Phase 4: Extended Soak Test (1 week minimum)
    [ ] Run in staging for 7 days continuous
    [ ] With REAL production traffic replay
    [ ] Monitor for:
        [ ] Memory leaks (heap grows over time)
        [ ] Intermittent failures (flapping)
        [ ] Latency spikes (thread pinning)
        [ ] Connection pool exhaustion
    [ ] If ANY of these occur: ‚õî STOP

[ ] Phase 5: Go/No-Go Decision
    [ ] Measure actual improvements:
        [ ] Memory reduction: __% (is it worth it?)
        [ ] Throughput increase: __% (real or measurement noise?)
        [ ] Latency improvement: __% (or degradation?)
    [ ] Calculate REAL ROI (see calculator)
    [ ] If ROI < 50%: ‚õî RECOMMEND NO-GO
    [ ] Get sign-off from:
        [ ] Engineering lead (technical feasibility)
        [ ] SRE/Ops team (operational risk)
        [ ] Product/Business (ROI justification)

[ ] Phase 6: Rollout (only if Phase 5 approved) (2-4 weeks)
    [ ] Blue-green deployment (instant rollback ready)
    [ ] 5% ‚Üí 10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% (slow rollout)
    [ ] At each stage, wait 48 hours
    [ ] Monitor SLOs religiously
    [ ] If ANY SLO breach: INSTANT ROLLBACK
    [ ] Document learnings (even if rollback)

[ ] Phase 7: Post-Mortem (regardless of outcome)
    [ ] What went right
    [ ] What went wrong
    [ ] Was the ROI achieved?
    [ ] Would we do it again?
    [ ] Share learnings with community
```

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES from typical upgrade guides:**
- ‚õî Multiple STOP points (most guides don't have these)
- ‚úÖ Real dependencies in testing (no mocking)
- üìä ROI calculation (not just "cool new tech")
- üö® Honest go/no-go decision (courage to cancel)

**What we did wrong:**
- ‚ùå Relied on unit tests (should have used real Locust master)
- ‚ùå Skipped dependency audit (assumed ZeroMQ would work)
- ‚ùå Didn't calculate ROI upfront (sunk cost fallacy)
- ‚ùå Kept going after red flags (should have stopped at iteration 3)

**What you should do:**
- ‚úÖ Follow this checklist religiously
- ‚úÖ Be ready to say "no" at any phase
- ‚úÖ Share this article with your team BEFORE starting
- ‚úÖ Remember: **Not upgrading is a valid, smart decision**

### Code Review Guidelines

**When reviewing virtual thread code, check for:**

1. **Pinning Risks**
   ```java
   // ‚ùå REJECT: JNI call on virtual thread
   Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
       nativeLib.call();  // Pins thread!
   });
   
   // ‚úÖ APPROVE: JNI on platform thread
   platformThreadPool.submit(() -> {
       nativeLib.call();
   });
   ```

2. **Synchronized Usage**
   ```java
   // ‚ö†Ô∏è FLAG: synchronized in virtual thread
   Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
       synchronized (lock) {  // Consider Lock instead
           criticalSection();
       }
   });
   ```

3. **ThreadLocal Proliferation**
   ```java
   // ‚ö†Ô∏è FLAG: ThreadLocal with virtual threads
   ThreadLocal<HeavyObject> tl = new ThreadLocal<>();
   // With 100k virtual threads = 100k HeavyObjects
   ```

4. **CPU-Bound Tasks**
   ```java
   // ‚ö†Ô∏è FLAG: No I/O in virtual thread
   Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
       calculatePi(1_000_000);  // Pure CPU, no benefit
   });
   ```

### Monitoring and Observability

**Essential JFR Events to Track**:
```bash
# Start application with JFR recording
java -XX:StartFlightRecording=\
  filename=recording.jfr,\
  settings=profile,\
  dumponexit=true \
  -jar app.jar

# Analyze thread pinning
jfr print --events jdk.VirtualThreadPinned recording.jfr

# Expected output (good):
# No events (or < 10/sec)

# Bad output:
# 847 events/sec at ZMQ.recv() ‚Üê Problem!
```

**Metrics to Dashboard**:
```
- Virtual thread count (should scale freely)
- Platform thread count (should be fixed)
- Carrier thread pool utilization
- Thread pinning events/sec (should be near zero)
- Heap usage for thread stacks (should be low)
- GC pause time (should improve)
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: No changes needed (virtual threads transparent to business logic)

**Integration Tests**: Add specific virtual thread scenarios
```java
@Test
void testHighConcurrencyWithVirtualThreads() {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    
    List<Future<String>> futures = IntStream.range(0, 10_000)
        .mapToObj(i -> executor.submit(() -> callAPI(i)))
        .toList();
    
    // All should complete without thread exhaustion
    futures.forEach(f -> assertDoesNotThrow(() -> f.get()));
}
```

**Load Tests**: Critical - measure before/after
```bash
# Baseline (Java 17)
wrk -t 12 -c 2000 -d 60s http://localhost:8080/api

# After upgrade (Java 21)
wrk -t 12 -c 100000 -d 60s http://localhost:8080/api
# Should handle 50x more connections
```

## Conclusion: The Uncomfortable Truth

Our journey from Java 17 to Java 21 with virtual threads taught us a **humbling lesson**: sometimes the newest technology isn't the right technology, and sometimes the brave decision is to not upgrade.

### What We Actually Learned

1. **Virtual threads are NOT ready for JNI-heavy applications** - Period. Full stop. Don't try to make it work.

2. **Unit tests lie** - 87/87 passing means nothing if you haven't tested with real dependencies under real load.

3. **Hybrid models sound good in theory** - Platform threads for RPC, virtual threads for tasks‚Äîelegant architecture, right? In practice: thread pinning persists because of transitive dependencies and internal library locking.

4. **The future MIGHT be bright** - Java 25+ FFM integration could solve this. Could. But that's 2-3 years away, and who knows if it'll actually work with complex libraries like ZeroMQ.

5. **ROI matters more than technology** - We spent $18,000 in engineering time to achieve -95% ROI. That's not innovation; that's expensive learning.

### Our ACTUAL Results

**What we achieved**:
- ‚úÖ 93% memory reduction (600KB ‚Üí 42.5KB per user) - impressive on paper
- ‚úÖ 87/87 unit tests passing - meaningless in practice
- ‚úÖ Cleaner GC characteristics - minor benefit
- ‚úÖ Deep understanding of virtual threads - expensive education

**What we lost**:
- ‚ùå Worker reliability (100% ‚Üí 72%) - **CRITICAL REGRESSION**
- ‚ùå RPC performance (12ms ‚Üí 720ms p99) - **60x WORSE**
- ‚ùå Production stability - **CANNOT DEPLOY**
- ‚ùå 3 weeks of engineering time - **120 hours wasted**
- ‚ùå Team morale - **frustration and disappointment**

**Final decision**: **Reverted to Java 17. Upgrade abandoned.**

### The Honest Recommendation

**For engineering teams evaluating Java 21**:

**If you use ANY native libraries (JNI)**:
- üõë **Don't upgrade for virtual threads**
- üìã **Wait for Java 25+ FFM integration**
- üí∞ **Spend time on actual business features instead**
- üéØ **Profile your existing system - it's probably fine**

**If you're pure Java (no native deps)**:
- ‚úÖ Virtual threads might help
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But test extensively with real dependencies
- üìä Calculate ROI before committing
- üö® Be ready to rollback

**If someone pressures you to "modernize"**:
- üìñ Share this article
- üí¨ Explain: "We're not behind; we're being strategic"
- üéØ Focus on: "Does it solve a real problem?"
- üíº Business value > Technology buzzwords

### What We're Doing Now

1. **Staying on Java 17 LTS** - stable, proven, boring (in a good way)
2. **Monitoring Java 25+ FFM progress** - from a safe distance
3. **Focusing on business features** - what actually matters
4. **Documenting this journey** - so others can learn without the pain

### Final Words

**We're not embarrassed by this "failure"** - we're sharing it because:
- Engineering is about learning
- Not every experiment succeeds
- Honest failure reports are more valuable than cherry-picked success stories
- Your time is valuable - don't repeat our mistakes

**The most important lesson**: **Sometimes the right decision is to NOT upgrade.**

Virtual threads are cool. They're clever. They're... not ready for everyone. And that's okay. 

We'll revisit this in 2-3 years when Java 25+ ships with FFM integration. Until then, Java 17 works just fine.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Production stable on Java 17** (where we should have stayed all along)

---

### Postscript: What We'd Tell Our Past Selves

**Day 1**: "Hey, before you spend 3 weeks on this‚Äîtest with the real Locust master first. You'll find out in 30 minutes that it doesn't work."

**Day 7**: "The thread pinning isn't going away. Stop trying to fix it with clever architectures."

**Day 14**: "ReentrantLock will only reduce pinning by 25%. Not worth the refactoring effort."

**Day 21**: "Just revert. It's okay. You learned a lot. Write a blog post and move on."

**Today**: "We should have written this article to save YOU the 3 weeks we wasted."

You're welcome.

*This article represents 120 hours of engineering effort, 7 architectural iterations, 847 thread pinning events per minute, and ultimately, a successful revert to Java 17. We're sharing it so you don't have to live through it.*
