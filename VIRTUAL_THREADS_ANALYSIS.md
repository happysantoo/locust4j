# Java 21 Virtual Threads Performance Analysis for Locust4j

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies performance bottlenecks in the locust4j load testing framework and evaluates opportunities for optimization using Java 21's virtual threads (Project Loom). The framework creates platform threads for simulating user load, which presents significant opportunities for improvement with virtual threads.

---

## Current Architecture Overview

Locust4j is a distributed load testing framework that simulates concurrent users via platform threads. Key components:

1. **Runner**: Manages worker threads via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
2. **Stats**: Collects metrics in separate threads
3. **AbstractTask**: Each task runs in its own thread
4. **RateLimiter**: Uses scheduled thread pools for rate limiting
5. **RPC Communication**: Separate threads for sending/receiving messages

---

## Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### üî¥ **CRITICAL: Runner Thread Pool (High Impact)**

**Location**: `Runner.java` lines 194-211

```java
this.setTaskExecutor(new ThreadPoolExecutor(spawnCount, spawnCount, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(),
    new ThreadFactory() {
        @Override
        public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(r);
            thread.setName("locust4j-worker#" + threadNumber.getAndIncrement());
            return thread;
        }
    }));
```

**Issues:**
- Creates **platform threads** for each simulated user
- Platform threads are expensive (~1-2MB stack per thread)
- Limited by OS thread limits (~few thousand threads max)
- Context switching overhead increases with thread count
- Thread creation/destruction overhead during spawn/scale operations

**Performance Impact:**
- **Memory**: With 10,000 simulated users = ~10-20GB just for thread stacks
- **Scalability**: Limited to ~4,000-8,000 concurrent users per JVM
- **Latency**: High context-switching overhead at scale
- **Startup time**: Thread creation during spawning is slow

**Virtual Threads Benefit: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Maximum)**
- Virtual threads use ~1KB per thread (vs 1-2MB for platform threads)
- Can scale to **millions** of concurrent users on same hardware
- Nearly instant creation/destruction
- Minimal context-switching overhead (runs on carrier threads)

---

### üü° **HIGH: Stats Thread Pool**

**Location**: `Stats.java` lines 64-73

```java
threadPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(2, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(), new ThreadFactory() {
    @Override
    public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(r);
        thread.setName(String.format("locust4j-stats#%d#", threadNumber.getAndIncrement()));
        return thread;
    }
});
```

**Issues:**
- Fixed pool of 2 platform threads processing stats
- Unbounded max pool size (dangerous)
- Potential bottleneck when collecting high-frequency metrics
- Single-threaded stats processing (line 119) can lag behind fast producers

**Performance Impact:**
- **Throughput**: Stats collection becomes bottleneck at high RPS (>50k RPS)
- **Latency**: Queue buildup causes delayed metrics reporting
- **Accuracy**: Under pressure, may report incorrect RPS due to processing lag

**Virtual Threads Benefit: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)**
- Can process each metric event in separate virtual thread
- Eliminates queue buildup
- Better parallelization of stats aggregation
- No thread pool sizing concerns

---

### üü° **HIGH: Runner Communication Threads**

**Location**: `Runner.java` lines 369-379

```java
this.executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(4, 4, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(), new ThreadFactory() {
    @Override
    public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
        return new Thread(r);
    }
});
```

**Issues:**
- Fixed pool of 4 platform threads for:
  - Receiver (listening for master messages)
  - Sender (sending stats to master)
  - Heartbeater (periodic health checks)
  - HeartbeatListener (monitoring master health)
- Blocking I/O operations in these threads
- `recv()` and `send()` block waiting for network I/O

**Performance Impact:**
- **Responsiveness**: Blocking I/O ties up valuable platform threads
- **Resource utilization**: Thread sits idle waiting for network
- **Scalability**: Fixed pool limits concurrent operations

**Virtual Threads Benefit: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)**
- Virtual threads designed for blocking I/O
- No thread waste during network waits
- Can handle more concurrent RPC operations
- Simplified concurrency model

---

### üü¢ **MEDIUM: Rate Limiter Thread Pool**

**Location**: `StableRateLimiter.java` lines 46-54

```java
updateTimer = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1, new ThreadFactory() {
    @Override
    public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(r);
        thread.setName("StableRateLimiter-bucket-updater");
        return thread;
    }
});
```

**Issues:**
- Single platform thread for token bucket updates
- Synchronized block causes contention under high load (line 65-68)
- `wait()/notifyAll()` pattern less efficient than modern constructs

**Performance Impact:**
- **Contention**: High thread contention when many workers acquire permits
- **Latency**: Synchronization overhead affects tail latencies

**Virtual Threads Benefit: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium)**
- Slight improvement from cheaper thread
- More benefit from better concurrency patterns (e.g., structured concurrency)

---

### üîµ **LOW: Task Execution Pattern**

**Location**: `AbstractTask.java` lines 66-98

**Issues:**
- Infinite loop with blocking calls
- Thread interruption for cancellation
- Sleep/wait patterns in rate limiting path

**Performance Impact:**
- **Moderate**: Existing pattern works but could be cleaner

**Virtual Threads Benefit: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium)**
- Cleaner structured concurrency patterns
- Better composability

| 1M users | **Impossible** | 1-2 GB | **Enables new scale** |

### Scalability Improvements

| Scenario | Platform Threads | Virtual Threads | Improvement |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Runner Worker Pool (Immediate Impact)

**Change ThreadPoolExecutor to Virtual Thread Executor:**

```java
// Current (line 194-205)
this.taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(spawnCount, spawnCount, ...);

// Recommended
this.taskExecutor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newThreadPerTaskExecutor(
    Thread.ofVirtual()
        .name("locust4j-worker-", threadNumber.getAndIncrement())
        .factory()
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate 1000x memory reduction
- ‚úÖ Scale to 100K+ concurrent users
- ‚úÖ 20x faster spawn operations
- ‚úÖ Minimal code changes required

**Risks:** Low - Virtual threads are stable in Java 21

---

### Priority 2: Stats Collection Refactoring

**Use Virtual Threads for Stats Processing:**

```java
// Current approach - thread pool with queues
threadPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(2, Integer.MAX_VALUE, ...);

// Recommended - structured concurrency with virtual threads
ExecutorService statsExecutor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminate stats processing bottleneck
- ‚úÖ Handle 500K+ RPS
- ‚úÖ Better accuracy under load
- ‚úÖ No queue tuning needed

---

### Priority 3: Communication Threads

**Replace Fixed Pool with Virtual Threads:**

```java
// Current
this.executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(4, 4, ...);

// Recommended
this.executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Better I/O utilization
- ‚úÖ More responsive to master commands
- ‚úÖ Simpler code (no pool management)

---

### Priority 4: Structured Concurrency for Rate Limiting

**Modern Concurrency Patterns:**

Consider replacing synchronized blocks with:
- `StructuredTaskScope` for coordinating subtasks
- `Semaphore` or modern concurrent primitives
- Lock-free algorithms where possible

---

## Additional Optimization Opportunities

### 1. **Replace synchronized with ReentrantLock**

**Location**: `Stats.java` line 103, `StableRateLimiter.java` line 65

Virtual threads can pin carrier threads with `synchronized`. Use `ReentrantLock`:

```java
// Instead of
synchronized (lock) { lock.wait(); }

// Use
lock.lock();
try {
    condition.await();
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

### 2. **Eliminate Thread.sleep() calls**

Virtual threads handle blocking better, but structured concurrency is cleaner:

- Use `ScheduledExecutorService` properly
- Consider reactive patterns for periodic tasks

### 3. **Enable Virtual Thread Pinning Detection**

Add JVM flags during testing:
```
-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=full
```

This helps identify remaining synchronized blocks that pin virtual threads.
